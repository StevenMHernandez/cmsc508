# CMSC 508 Database Theory project

## Setup

Copy `config/application.yml.example` to `config/application.yml`. Update this `application.yml` file with google api credentials.
See the google drive for the api credentials.

Run in IntelliJ.

## Backend

We will be developing this application using [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).

## Design

We are using [Bagpakk](http://brutaldesign.github.io/bagpakk/) for our base css styles.
You can take a look at the [html](https://github.com/brutaldesign/bagpakk/blob/master/index.html) for that website, to determine how to setup our own html.

## Javascript

Currently, we have [angular](https://angularjs.org/) just to handle some simple login/logout interaction on the main page. This should be removed soon.
